# Trustless AI Agents in DeFi: Introducing Underscore

## AI Agents and the Trust Problem

AI agents in DeFi remain experimental. Mistakes—sometimes severe—can happen, and onchain transactions are irreversible. The risk: people can lose real money. Even if AI were infallible, using it for financial activities demands enormous trust. You must trust that server-side wallet infrastructures won’t be compromised, that developers holding private keys won’t “rug,” and that closed-source systems won’t fail you. In DeFi, that level of trust contradicts our core ethos.

## DeFi’s Ethos: Minimizing Trust

Seasoned DeFi users understand that the fewer intermediaries we trust, the better. We’ve seen how quickly things go wrong—even with well-intentioned teams. Private keys get leaked, wallets drained, funds lost. Yet the promise of AI plus DeFi (DeFAI) is enormous: autonomous yield optimization, proactive risk monitoring, and round-the-clock portfolio management. We want these benefits—without exposing our assets to needless risk.

## The Balancing Act: Safety vs. Agency

How do we unleash AI agents in DeFi without losing control of our funds? How do we balance the power of AI with robust security measures? That’s where **Underscore** comes in.

## Introducing Underscore

Underscore is onchain infrastructure designed to give AI agents freedom to operate—within boundaries you define. It allows you to create an **Agentic Wallet**: a personal smart contract that connects to DeFi protocols with AI assistance. Crucially:

- **Non-Custodial**: Only you can withdraw funds.
- **Granular Control**: You set which assets and protocols the AI can interact with.
- **Rule-Based Actions**: Agents operate strictly within your specified parameters.
- **Extensible by Design**: New DeFi integrations (“legos”) can be added without moving funds or upgrading your wallet.

## Why It Matters

- **Minimized Trust**: Instead of relying on server-side wallets or closed-source code, you trust audited, immutable smart contracts.
- **Auditability**: Open-source logic means anyone can review it. No black boxes or hidden risks.
- **Scale DeFAI Safely**: We combine AI’s capabilities with onchain rule enforcement. You retain ultimate control over your assets while your AI agent does the heavy lifting.

## The Future of DeFAI

We can’t fully trust AI agents (yet). We can’t fully trust closed, centralized infrastructures. But we can trust permissionless smart contracts governed by immutable code and transparent rules. This is how we scale DeFAI. This is how we unlock the true potential of onchain AI-driven finance—without compromising on security.
